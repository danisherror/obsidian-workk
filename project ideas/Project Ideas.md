- make a voice verifying
	- verifying the users voice and tell that whose voice it it
	- By doing this you can learn, how to do the voice verification
	- After this you can do the verifying the birds voice(this project is main {voice verification of user is the steeping step for bird voice recognition})
- verify the voice of the bird
- I have the idea of making the app that allow user to send the map location to the driver without sharing the details of users
	- In this project we will give token to the each request and driver can verify the map with users by verifying the token with the users
	- So no information leak of users. 
	- Allow the deletion of token after 2 days, so that there is no link to user allow the user to be privacy feature enabled.
- create the 3d view of a person by taking the photos 
- find the location and user information using the ip address
