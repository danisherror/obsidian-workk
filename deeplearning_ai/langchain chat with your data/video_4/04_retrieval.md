# Retrieval

Retrieval is the centerpiece of our retrieval augmented generation (RAG) flow. 

Let's get our vectorDB from before.

## Vectorstore retrieval



```python
import os
import openai
import sys
sys.path.append('../..')

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```


```python
#!pip install lark
```

### Similarity Search


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
persist_directory = 'docs/chroma/'
```


```python
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma(
    persist_directory=persist_directory,
    embedding_function=embedding
)
```


```python
print(vectordb._collection.count())
```

    209



```python
texts = [
    """The Amanita phalloides has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp).""",
    """A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Amanita phalloides. Some varieties are all-white.""",
    """A. phalloides, a.k.a Death Cap, is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms.""",
]
```


```python
smalldb = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embedding=embedding)
```


```python
question = "Tell me about all-white mushrooms with large fruiting bodies"
```


```python
smalldb.similarity_search(question, k=2)
```




    [Document(page_content='A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Amanita phalloides. Some varieties are all-white.', metadata={}),
     Document(page_content='The Amanita phalloides has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp).', metadata={})]




```python
smalldb.max_marginal_relevance_search(question,k=2, fetch_k=3)
```




    [Document(page_content='A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Amanita phalloides. Some varieties are all-white.', metadata={}),
     Document(page_content='A. phalloides, a.k.a Death Cap, is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms.', metadata={})]



### Addressing Diversity: Maximum marginal relevance

Last class we introduced one problem: how to enforce diversity in the search results.
 
`Maximum marginal relevance` strives to achieve both relevance to the query *and diversity* among the results.


```python
question = "what did they say about matlab?"
docs_ss = vectordb.similarity_search(question,k=3)
```


```python
docs_ss[0].page_content[:100]
```




    'those homeworks will be done in either MATLA B or in Octave, which is sort of — I \nknow some people '




```python
docs_ss[1].page_content[:100]
```




    'those homeworks will be done in either MATLA B or in Octave, which is sort of — I \nknow some people '



Note the difference in results with `MMR`.


```python
docs_mmr = vectordb.max_marginal_relevance_search(question,k=3)
```


```python
docs_mmr[0].page_content[:100]
```




    'those homeworks will be done in either MATLA B or in Octave, which is sort of — I \nknow some people '




```python
docs_mmr[1].page_content[:100]
```




    'algorithm then? So what’s different? How come  I was making all that noise earlier about \nleast squa'



### Addressing Specificity: working with metadata

In last lecture, we showed that a question about the third lecture can include results from other lectures as well.

To address this, many vectorstores support operations on `metadata`.

`metadata` provides context for each embedded chunk.


```python
question = "what did they say about regression in the third lecture?"
```


```python
docs = vectordb.similarity_search(
    question,
    k=3,
    filter={"source":"docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf"}
)
```


```python
for d in docs:
    print(d.metadata)
```

    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 0}
    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 14}
    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 4}



```python

```

### Addressing Specificity: working with metadata using self-query retriever

But we have an interesting challenge: we often want to infer the metadata from the query itself.

To address this, we can use `SelfQueryRetriever`, which uses an LLM to extract:
 
1. The `query` string to use for vector search
2. A metadata filter to pass in as well

Most vector databases support metadata filters, so this doesn't require any new databases or indexes.


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
```


```python
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="source",
        description="The lecture the chunk is from, should be one of `docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf`, `docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture02.pdf`, or `docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf`",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="page",
        description="The page from the lecture",
        type="integer",
    ),
]
```

**Note:** The default model for `OpenAI` ("from langchain.llms import OpenAI") is `text-davinci-003`. Due to the deprication of OpenAI's model `text-davinci-003` on 4 January 2024, you'll be using OpenAI's recommended replacement model `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` instead.


```python
document_content_description = "Lecture notes"
llm = OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectordb,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    verbose=True
)
```


```python
question = "what did they say about regression in the third lecture?"
```

**You will receive a warning** about predict_and_parse being deprecated the first time you executing the next line. This can be safely ignored.


```python
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
```

    /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/langchain/chains/llm.py:275: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.
      warnings.warn(


    query='regression' filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='source', value='docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf') limit=None



```python
for d in docs:
    print(d.metadata)
```

    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 14}
    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 0}
    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 10}
    {'source': 'docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture03.pdf', 'page': 10}


### Additional tricks: compression

Another approach for improving the quality of retrieved docs is compression.

Information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. 

Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.

Contextual compression is meant to fix this. 


```python
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor
```


```python
def pretty_print_docs(docs):
    print(f"\n{'-' * 100}\n".join([f"Document {i+1}:\n\n" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]))

```


```python
# Wrap our vectorstore
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct")
compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
```


```python
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=compressor,
    base_retriever=vectordb.as_retriever()
)
```


```python
question = "what did they say about matlab?"
compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)
```

    base_retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(search_type = "mmr")
)
```


```python

    - learning algorithms to teach a car how to drive at reasonably high speeds off roads avoiding obstacles.
    - that's a robot program med by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a sort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get over an obstacle.
    - So I think all of these are robots that I think are very difficult to hand-code a controller for by learning these sorts of learning algorithms.
    - Just a couple more last things, but let me just check what questions you have right now.
    - So if there are no questions, I'll just close with two reminders, which are after class today or as you start to talk with other people in this class, I just encourage you again to start to form project partners, to try to find project partners to do your project with.
    - And also, this is a good time to start forming study groups, so either talk to your friends or post in the newsgroup, but we just encourage you to try to start to do both of those today, okay? Form study groups, and try to find two other project partners.


## Other types of retrieval

It's worth noting that vectordb as not the only kind of tool to retrieve documents. 

The `LangChain` retriever abstraction includes other ways to retrieve documents, such as TF-IDF or SVM.


```python
from langchain.retrievers import SVMRetriever
from langchain.retrievers import TFIDFRetriever
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
```


```python
# Load PDF
loader = PyPDFLoader("docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf")
pages = loader.load()
all_page_text=[p.page_content for p in pages]
joined_page_text=" ".join(all_page_text)

# Split
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 1500,chunk_overlap = 150)
splits = text_splitter.split_text(joined_page_text)

```


```python
# Retrieve
svm_retriever = SVMRetriever.from_texts(splits,embedding)
tfidf_retriever = TFIDFRetriever.from_texts(splits)
```


```python
question = "What are major topics for this class?"
docs_svm=svm_retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
docs_svm[0]
```

Although many people used to th ink it's not possible to take a single \nimage and build a 3D model, but using a lear ning algorithm and that sort of clustering \nalgorithm is the first step.

So again, taking th e same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algor ithm, you can group the pixels into different \nregions.
