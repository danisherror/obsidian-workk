> Demystifying AI
- ANI (Artificial narrow intelligence)
	- e.g. smart speakers, self-driving cars, web search, AI in farming and factories.
- Generative AI:
	- e.g. ChatGPT, bard, DALL-E 
- AGI (artificial general intelligence):
	- Do anything a human can do
--- 
> Machine learning:
- Supervised Learning:
	- spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving car, visual inspection, chatbot
	- LLMs are built by using supervised learning (a->B) to repeatedly predict the next word.
	- It is basically just leans input , output, A to B mapping
	- traditional ai < small neural net < medium neural net < Large neural net
---
> Data
- table of data -> dataset
- Acquiring data:
	- Manual labeling
	- from observing behaviors
---
> Terminology of AI
- Machine learning: 
	- Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
		- Often result in piece of software
- Data Science:
	- Science of extracting knowledge and insight from data
- Deep Learning:
	- Artificial neural network:
		- It takes the input A and then give the output B
	- neurons
	- Big mathematical equation
	- Neural networks were originally inspired by the brain, but the details of how they work are almost completely unrelated to how biological brains work

> AI transformation
- Execute pilot project to gain momentum
- Build an in-house AI team
- Provide broad AI training
- Develop an AI strategy
- Develop internal and external communications

> what machine learning can and cannot do
- anything you can do with 2 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate.
- ML tends to work well when:
	- Learning a "simple" concept
	- There is lots of data available
- ML tends to work poorly when:
	- Learning complex concepts from small amount of data
	- It is asked to perform on new types of data
